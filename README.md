# Generate New AnyDesk ID

This script generates a new AnyDesk ID (Windows only for now, I'm working on the Linux one) by deleting the directories where AnyDesk stores it's ID data (C:\ProgramData\AnyDesk in Windows, /root/.anydesk in Linux). It also deletes all the AnyDesk user profiles from local users ()
